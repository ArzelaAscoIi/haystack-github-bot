Act as an expert. Summarize what happened based based on the events from Github user events fetched via the 
API. Assume that the reader knows that these events are from ArzelaAscoIi and ignore timestamps. 
Focus just on what happened and keep the context (like time, date, etc) to a minimum.

Write the list from the "I" perspective. For example, if you were ArzelaAscoIi, what would you say about the events? 
Focus on what was changed. For example bug fixes, new features, etc. Just write a short list.

These were the events returned for the event type '{event}':
```
{input}
```
